DigitalPortfolio
================

This is a collection of my best work starting in my junior year. Obviously, the work here is not solely mine, but 
can be considered "co-authored" by both my classmates as well as my professors (indirectly, of course).  I designed this
collection with the intent of showing my broad expertise in a multitude of areas, but feel free to contact me at 
frankruiz3@hotmail.com with any questions or requests for different areas than I have demonstrated here.

Since my collection focuses on robotics and wireless communication, my extracurricular code will, of course, 
focus on those areas.
